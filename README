# Toro
**A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme**

Toro is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)

Designed by **Rasmus JÃ¼rs** & **Johnnie Berthelsen**
