# [Toro Theme](http://jurs.me)

This theme is built on tidbits of some of the best souces around the web.

The grid is a customised version of the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) grid. The main difference being the reversal of the media queries. I dont feel that mobile first at the cost of IE8 support is worthwhile yet.

A few of the Foundation design elements are also carried over (Panels, forms etc.).

Ill write about the rest of the stuff later...
